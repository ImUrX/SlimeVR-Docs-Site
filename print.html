<p>Welcome to the SlimeVR documentation. This site covers how to <a href="diy/README.html">build your own SlimeVR trackers</a>, <a href="firmware/README.html">install or update an existing tracker's firmware</a>, <a href="server/README.html">install and configure the SlimeVR Server</a>, or <a href="tools/owoTrack.html">use your mobile phones as SlimeVR trackers</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You need at least 5 trackers (built boards or phones) for proper full body tracking (FBT). Alternatively, you can build a single tracker or use 1 phone/tablet for just waist tracking if you wish to test the tracking without investing in a full kit.</p>

<h3 id="1-build-them-from-scratch-the-diy-route"><a class="header" href="#1-build-them-from-scratch-the-diy-route">1. Build them from scratch (The DIY route)</a></h3>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dLJBuM9.jpg" alt="Example DIY build" /></p>
<p><em>Example build by NightyIceC00kie</em></p>
<p>You get yourself a <strong>microcontroller</strong>, an <strong>IMU</strong> <a href="https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Tracker-ESP/blob/main/README.md">(supported IMUs)</a>, <strong>a battery</strong>, and <strong>a battery charger</strong> (These parts will be explained in detail). Optionally, you can add sliding switches, safety diodes, and a few resistors to measure battery percentages. You then solder it all together (soldering is important as good connections to the pins is required for your tracker to function). Alternatively, you can order a base board from a custom PMC manufacturer (please check the pins in the discord‚Äôs pcb channel for more information).</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Cheapest and fastest to obtain trackers (apart from using a phone you already have). Full documentation on this site to cover the process, assuming you understand how to solder. Flexibility in construction options allows for budget to advanced builds.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> You will need to solder some wires, have a basic understanding of electronics, and you are limited in how small the trackers can get. DIY builds require time to assemble and may require self-repairs from time to time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong> There is a seller on Amazon selling DIY SlimeVR trackers. Due to a significant number of users reporting issues with these trackers, they cannot be recommended unless you are savvy enough to potentially diagnose any issues as if you were DIY'ing SlimeVR trackers yourself. If you purchase them, you are doing so at your own risk.</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/diyKit.jpg" alt="DIY kit" /></p>
<p><em>A prototype of DIY-Kit boards and wires, which are identical to those in our standard Tracker Sets, but without enclosures and other accessories.</em></p>
<p>You buy the <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/slimevr/slimevr-full-body-tracker"><strong>official DIY Kit</strong></a> which includes all the boards and cables you need, get a LiPo battery, and attach batteries to the boards. All you need is to 3D print (or build) yourself a nice casing and get straps (or get creative and tape them with electrical tape to your body).</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> No or little soldering required, tested boards, the smallest possible design, cheaper alternative to buying completed SlimeVR trackers. You can customize cases and straps.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> At this point, you could just buy completed SlimeVR trackers. Import limitations and shipping costs apply. It will cost more than the first option due to shipping, import fees, and construction costs. Due to the chip shortage currently affecting the world, this option is currently planned to ship in November of 2022. Limited supply.</p>

<p><img src="assets/img/slimeVRProduction.jpg" alt="Prebuilt tracker" /></p>
<p><em>Prototypes of a SlimeVR Tracker</em></p>
<p>You buy fully built trackers for pre-order at <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/slimevr/slimevr-full-body-tracker">Crowd Supply</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> A premium build of the SlimeVR trackers with a small footprint with no physical build required.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Due to the chip shortage currently affecting the world, this option is currently planned to ship in November of 2022. Limited supply.</p>
<h3 id="4-use-phones-instead-of-trackers"><a class="header" href="#4-use-phones-instead-of-trackers">4. Use phones instead of trackers</a></h3>
<p>It is possible to use a phone in place of a tracker, please check the  <a href="tools/owoTrack.html">owoTrack mobile application</a>. Note that this option varies depending on your phone make and model, there have been issues with connections, the application being suspended, and a handful of others. Phone straps are also required to be sourced based on phone shape, size, and mount location.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> If you have 5 phones lying around, you can have FBT set up very quickly. You can also use this option to sub in phones for any missing trackers from the previous options.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Not all phones are supported. Quality of tracking can differ depending on make and model of phone. Your experience may differ wildly depending on your setup.</p>
<p>If you have any problems, feel free to reach out on the <a href="https://discord.gg/SlimeVR">SlimeVR discord</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-slimevr"><a class="header" href="#what-is-slimevr">What is SlimeVR?</a></h2>
<p>SlimeVR is a low cost solution to Full Body Tracking in VR. It uses forward kinematics to build a model of your skeleton calculated from the rotation of each individual tracker, with your headset and controllers being the only absolute position known.</p>
<p><img src="assets/img/ostriches.gif" alt="Skeleton tracking" /></p>
<p><em>Gif thanks to Butterscotch. Dance thanks to Mighty</em></p>
<p>Because the headset is a known position and rotation is derived from it, it does not require lighthouses or other forms of additional tracking to model your movement. Your headset and controllers‚Äô built in tracking of the hands manages your shoulders and arms. SlimeVR uses data from Inertial measurement units (IMU) to determine this rotation, and the number of IMU used determines how many tracking points are available.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-trackers-do-you-need"><a class="header" href="#how-many-trackers-do-you-need">How many trackers do you need?</a></h2>
<p>Depending on how you plan to use FBT in VR, choose one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower-Body Set (5 IMUs) - Your waist, legs, knees and feet are positionally tracked. Any bending of the waist or sitting down will have issues with tracking, and the orientation of your feet will not be tracked.</li>
<li>Core Set (6 IMUs) - In addition to the previous set this adds a tracker to the chest, this allows for much more accurate tracking while you're laying down, sitting or even just bending over.</li>
<li>Enhanced Core Set (8 IMUs) - In addition to the previous set, you can now also wiggle your peets. If you plan on lying or sitting down a lot this adds a lot of emotiveness to your poses.</li>
<li>Full-Body Set (10 IMUs) - In addition to the previous set, you can now move your elbows independently from your controllers in VR. Useful for dancers or additional immersion.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you look at the gif above, each line there represents a tracked 'bone'. The more points of rotation you add the more defined the final tracking is, as an example the gif above only has the &quot;Core Set&quot; and as such there is no feet rotation.</p>
<p>For more information on what these tracking options look like, please refer to this video:</p>

</div>
<h2 id="what-is-an-extension"><a class="header" href="#what-is-an-extension">What is an extension?</a></h2>
<p>An extension is a singular auxiliary IMU attached to a primary tracker and placed at another location. This allows you to build a secondary tracker without the need for an extra battery, charge board or microcontroller. These are sometimes referred to as AUX trackers.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OxED2eX.png" alt="img" /></p>
<p><em>Example extension built by Rames The Generic#3540</em></p>
<p>The length of the extension is dependent on the cabling used to connect them (shorter than 80cm is a safe range). For more information please <a href="diy/tracker-schematics.html">check the tracker schematics page.</a></p>
<p>The suggested extension locations are:</p>
<ol>
<li>A chest extension attached to the waist tracker.</li>
<li>A left foot extension attached to the left ankle tracker.</li>
<li>A right foot extension attached to the right ankle tracker.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the Crowd Supply store page and on our discord server, you may find a notation that specifies the number of primary and auxiliary IMUs with a plus sign. For example, the Enhanced Core Set noted above would be called a 5+3 set up, which consists of 5 microcontrollers and 8 IMU. For a better visual on how this looks when on a person, please check the <a href="server/putting-on-trackers.html#recommended-mounting-points">recommended mounting points section of the server set up</a>.</p>
<p>Please note: building extensions is not necessary, as the foot and chest trackers will work as standalone trackers if you would prefer. However, these docs assume that you are building them as extensions.</p>

<p>Turn each tracker on and see if they work.</p>
<p>Each tracker should blink an LED briefly on startup, and then blink every few seconds to indicate its status as follows:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align: center">Number of blinks</th><th style="text-align: left">Status</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td style="text-align: center">1</td><td style="text-align: left">Tracker is ready</td></tr>

</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>If a tracker doesn't start up, try charging it. Connect the tracker via USB port to your PC or any USB charger. A red LED light should light up to indicate that it's charging. A green LED or blue LED light means it's fully charged (LED might be a different colour depending on your charging board). Try turning the tracker on during charging to see if it works.</p>
<p><strong>Please note that as a rule, DIY trackers should be kept off while charging outside of this specific case.</strong></p>
<h2 id="imu-calibration"><a class="header" href="#imu-calibration">IMU Calibration</a></h2>
<p>If you have MPU6050 or MPU6500-based trackers, make sure that when you turn on your tracker it's lying on a flat surface. The sensors need to calibrate for 20-30 seconds in a stable environment. This should be done every time you turn on your trackers. Failing to do so will result in an increased rate of drift.</p>
<p>If you have MPU9250, BMI160, or MPU+QMC5883L-based tracker you need to calibrate the IMU before it will work correctly. This calibration only needs to be done once. You can only calibrate one IMU at a time, so if you have any extensions, they will also need to be calibrated.</p>
<p>To calibrate your IMU:</p>
<ol>
<li>Plug in your microcontroller (D1 Mini, NodeMCU, or other)</li>
<li>Open the SlimeVR server, and click <strong>Settings</strong>, and then click <strong>Serial Console</strong> under <strong>Utilities</strong>.</li>
<li>Flip the IMU you want to calibrate upside down and press the reset button on your micro controller. You should see a message indicating that you need to flip the IMU right side up to begin calibration.</li>
<li>Upon flipping the IMU over, calibration should begin. To successfully calibrate your IMU you need to gently rotate the IMU in all 3 axes.</li>
<li>After approximately 60 seconds has passed, the tracker should be successfully calibrated and will begin to show rotation in the SlimeVR server.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other IMUs, such as the BNO085 or ICM20948 do not require any specific manual calibration and can be used immediately.</p>
<h2 id="check-that-the-driver-loads-and-connects"><a class="header" href="#check-that-the-driver-loads-and-connects">Check that the Driver Loads and Connects</a></h2>

<li>
<p>Start the SlimeVR Server through the start menu via the &quot;SlimeVR Server&quot; shortcut.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restart SteamVR. Now you should see 3 trackers active in SteamVR:</p>

<p>This guide should help you set up SlimeVR trackers and software.</p>
<h2 id="connecting-trackers"><a class="header" href="#connecting-trackers">Connecting trackers</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are using DIY trackers with hardcoded the WiFi credentials or phones with owoTrack, you can skip to assigning your trackers. However, if you hardcoded the WiFi credentials and are having trouble connecting these steps may still be helpful for diagnosing the issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open the SlimeVR Server and click <strong>Setup Wizard</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="server/../assets/img/Setup_Welcome.png" alt="img" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Input your WiFi credentials, so that your tracker can connect to WiFi, then click <strong>Submit</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="server/../assets/img/Setup_WiFi.png" alt="img" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plug in a tracker one at a time. You should then see your tracker appear after a little while. Click <strong>I connected all my trackers</strong> once you're done.</p>
<p><img src="server/../assets/img/Setup_Connect-Trackers.png" alt="img" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hover over and click on the unassigned tracking points that you want to use. Shaking your tracker will highlight it. Click <strong>I Assigned all the trackers</strong> once you're done.</p>
<p><img src="server/../assets/img/Setup_Assignment.png" alt="img" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Congratulations! You connected all of your trackers, but there's still more left to do. Click <strong>I'm ready</strong> once you have your trackers on.</p>
<p><img src="server/../assets/img/Setup_NotDone.png" alt="img" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This next part is for making sure that your trackers will move in the right direction. Simply follow the instructions shown and then click <strong>Next step</strong> once your mounting rotations have been calibrated. More information on mounting can be found on the <a href="server/putting-on-trackers.html">Putting on your trackers page</a>.</p>
<p><img src="server/../assets/img/Setup_Mounting.png" alt="img" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At this time, the reset tutorial isn't ready, but you can check <a href="server/setting-reset-bindings.html">the page on reset bindings</a> for more information in the meantime. Simply click <strong>Continue</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="server/../assets/img/Setup_Reset.png" alt="img" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You'll want to be in VR for this final step. This involves wiggling around with your feet planted so that your body proportions can be determined. Simply follow the instructions shown. Be sure to verify your results and that nothing is obviously incorrect like having a neck length of 100 cm! Click <strong>Continue</strong> once you're done.</p>
<p><img src="server/../assets/img/Setup_Proportions.png" alt="img" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You're done! If you've made it through all that, you should be ready to start using SlimeVR!</p>

</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="troubleshooting"><a class="header" href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h3>
<p>If all trackers don't show up, this can be caused by Windows Firewall blocking the connection. To fix this, go to SlimeVR Server folder and run <code>firewall.bat</code> as administrator. There are additional steps that can be taken on the <a href="server/../common-issues.html#the-trackers-are-connected-to-my-wifi-but-dont-turn-up-on-slimevr">common issues page</a> if this does not work.</p>
<p>For additional information on trackers, you may want to enable <strong>Developer mode</strong>. The setting for this can be found under <strong>Settings</strong>, <strong>General</strong>, and then <strong>Interface</strong>.</p>
<p>If some trackers don't show up, try turning them off and on again. You can rotate tracker around and see it change rotation in the server to figure out which tracker is which.</p>
<p>If some trackers don't change their rotation as you move them (including extensions), or display 0 0 0 rotation, try turning them off and on again, usually it should fix the issue.</p>
<p>If any tracker displays ERROR as it's status, or have orange and blue light permanently on, that's not good. Try restarting them and see if it helps. If not, contact Eiren.</p>

<p>Before launching SteamVR, check the checkboxes relative to how many SteamVR virtual trackers you wish to spawn.</p>
<p><img src="server/../assets/img/SteamVRTrackers.png" alt="img" /></p>
<p>Please note that this only affects the virtual trackers in Steam and not your SlimeVR trackers. If you only have Waist and Legs ticked, they will still be accessing up to an 8 IMU setup (waist, chest, upper legs, lower legs and feet). At the moment, VRChat supports 11 virtual trackers, including headset and controllers.</p>
<h3 id="steamvr-trackers-to-enable-depending-on-your-set"><a class="header" href="#steamvr-trackers-to-enable-depending-on-your-set">SteamVR Trackers to Enable Depending on Your Set</a></h3>

<li>7+3: <em>chest</em>, waist, <em>knees</em>, feet, <em>elbows</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Trackers marked in italic should only be enabled if your game or application supports it (VRChat does).</em></p>
<p>One peculiarity to note is that SlimeVR lower leg and feet trackers will combine into a single SteamVR tracker. Similarly, hip and waist trackers will also combine into a single SteamVR tracker.</p>
<p>Do not enable trackers you do not need as this could lead to in-game calibration issues.</p>
<p>Launch SteamVR when you're ready.</p>
<h3 id="access-the-slimevr-server-in-vr"><a class="header" href="#access-the-slimevr-server-in-vr">Access the SlimeVR Server in VR</a></h3>

<p>When getting in VR, your trackers will be floating all over the place and won't be following your body. To fix this, you need to perform a tracker reset.</p>
<p>To Perform a tracker reset:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stand straight, legs vertical (not together), trackers facing their designated direction.</li>
<li>Press the <strong>RESET</strong> button in the SlimeVR Server.</li>
<li>Look forward and maintain your pose until the countdown finishes.</li>
<li>After the timer ends you should see that the trackers point in the right direction and are under you.</li>
</ol>
<p>Look down. After resetting, the trackers should be directly under you and follow your movement; however as you haven't configured the body proportions yet, they may not be positioned accurately compared to your real body.</p>
<p>See <a href="server/setting-reset-bindings.html">setting a reset keybind</a> for a quick and easy way to reset your trackers while in VR.</p>

<p>Put trackers on according to the pictures. These are the recommended positions, you can use any comfortable position for you, but there are a few rules:</p>
<p><img src="server/../assets/img/Tracker_Settings.png" alt="img" /></p>
<ol>
<li>You should set Tracker role to the proper role according to body part you put your tracker on. This includes tracker extensions. Use pictures to reference role names and their recommended mounting points.</li>
<li>You should set Tracker direction according to your mounting direction. <strong>You can only mount trackers facing forward, left, backwards, or right. You can not mount trackers facing other directions (yet). When you mount it, make sure they sit tight, and face as much in this direction as possible when you're standing straight. I.e. &quot;Forward&quot; should face the same way your HMD is facing when you look forward while standing!</strong></li>
<li>You can mount trackers tiled forward/backward or on the side, this will not mess up the tracking.</li>
<li>You can mount trackers in any place on the designated body part you find comfortable, however the less the area is deformed by muscular movement the better the tracking will be. Make sure the tracker moves when you bend the joint to register movement. <strong>Pay special attention to the waist tracker, there are many places where you can mount it and it won't register you bending over. Mount it above your hip, around the level of your belly button.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="recommended-tracker-placement"><a class="header" href="#recommended-tracker-placement">Recommended Tracker Placement</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>5 trackers: chest, upper legs and lower legs.</li>
<li>6 trackers: chest, hip, upper legs and lower legs.</li>
<li>7 trackers: chest, waist, hip, upper legs and lower legs.</li>
<li>8 trackers: chest, hip, upper legs, lower legs and feet.</li>
<li>9 trackers: chest, waist, hip, upper legs, lower legs and feet.</li>
<li>10 trackers: chest, hip, upper legs, lower legs, feet and upper arms.</li>

<p>Recommended tracker positions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chest: facing forward middle of the chest.</li>
<li>Waist: facing foward or to the side on your waist (above you hip, around the level of your belly button) depending on your build.</li>
<li>Hip: facing forward or back on your hip (where you put your belt).</li>
<li>Upper leg: just above the knee or higher up the thigh depending on your build.</li>
<li>Lower leg: on the ankle facing any direction you like.</li>
<li>Foot: on top of the foot. Trackers 'up' facing toward the ankle, and 'front' facing the ceiling.</li>
<li>Upper arm: on upper arm (above elbow), on the side or back (forward being your bicep).</li>
<li>Lower arm: on lower arm (below elbow), inwards, close to the elbow.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also recommended to mount your trackers directly on bare skin for better adhesion (more stability and less sliding).</p>

<p>SlimeVR uses a virtual skeleton to compute positions from the data it receives from your trackers. As part of the setup procedure, this skeleton is made using your real world measurements (in cm) for various body parts in order for SlimeVR to compute its skeleton accurately to your real body.
While these values can be input directly into the SlimeVR server, it is recommended you use the AutoBone system. Once you have completed the auto-configuration process, it is also recommended to use the measurements above to confirm the accuracy before finalising the automatic values. There is also an option to <a href="server/body-config.html#configuring-body-proportions-in-vr">visually check within VR</a>, described at the bottom of this page.</p>

## AutoBone / Automatic body proportions calibration
<p>AutoBone (also known as &quot;automatic body proportions calibration&quot;) removes the need to manually input bone lengths using automatic bone length calculations recorded through user movements. AutoBone is available as &quot;Automatic calibration&quot; under the &quot;Body Proportions&quot; tab of the GUI.</p>
<p>This bypasses the need to manually set the bone lengths, although it is still possible to fine-tune values manually if needed.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use"><a class="header" href="#how-to-use">How to Use</a></h3>
<p><em>Make sure the headset is ON and worn on your head during this process.</em></p>
<p>Before using AutoBone, you must prepare your body proportion values by standing straight up and pressing the &quot;Reset all proportions&quot; button under the &quot;Body Proportions&quot; tab. If this is not done, then the height value used in calculations will be incorrect.</p>
<p><strong>VERY IMPORTANT:</strong> During the recording, you <strong>must</strong> keep your heels in the same position, otherwise the resulting values will be invalid.</p>
<div class="video-container">
<iframe width="100%" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z_HhxXvwkk8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>To use AutoBone, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the &quot;Body Proportions&quot; tab and ensure you're on &quot;Automatic calibration&quot; and not &quot;Manual calibration&quot;</li>
<li>Stand up straight and press the <strong>&quot;Reset all proportions&quot;</strong> button.</li>
<li>Follow the steps shown on the GUI.
<ul>
<li>If you're using SlimeVR version 0.6.0 or older, these instructions will be more up-to-date and you can safely ignore the instructions on the GUI. To continue using these instructions on SlimeVR version 0.6.0 or older, you can skip to step 3 &quot;Get ready to move&quot; on the GUI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure to keep your heels on the ground and in the same position for the duration of recording.</li>
<li>Press the <strong>&quot;Start Recording&quot;</strong> button, the GUI will indicate that recording has started. The recording will last for approximately 20 seconds.</li>
<li><strong>Move</strong> until the text on the button changes back to &quot;Start Recording&quot;, the current best known movements for calibration are as follows, returning to standing up straight after each step:
<ol>
<li>Standing up straight, roll your head in a circle.</li>
<li>Bend your back forwards and squat. While squatting, look to your left, then to your right.</li>
<li>Twist your upper body to the left (counter-clockwise), then reach down towards the ground.</li>
<li>Twist your upper body to the right (clockwise), then reach down towards the ground.</li>
<li>Roll your hips in a circular motion as if you're using a hula hoop.</li>
<li>If there is time left on the recording, you can repeat these steps until it's finished.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>When the recording is done, SlimeVR will process the recording. After processing is done, you will be able to see new values for your body proportions reported in cm.</li>
<li>To use the calculated values, press the <strong>&quot;They're correct&quot;</strong> button. If the values do not look right, you can try recording again using the &quot;Redo recording&quot; button - the recording will start immediately, so make sure you're ready.</li>

### Common Issues / Debugging
<p>If you are having issues with AutoBone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you kept your heels in the same position while recording, don't lift your legs or walk around.</li>
<li>Make sure your headset isn't lagging, freezing, or teleporting (use the desktop view in SteamVR to start recording).</li>
<li>Double check that your trackers are mounted correctly and functioning properly.</li>
<li>Verify that you pressed the &quot;Reset all proportions&quot; button under the &quot;Body Proportions&quot; tab while standing up straight to calibrate your height properly.</li>
<li>Make sure the height in the &quot;Manual calibration&quot; section under the &quot;Body Proportions&quot; tab is accurate to your own height.</li>
</ul>
<p>If none of these help, you can ask for help in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/817184208525983775/932251355886809118">#autobone</a> channel in the <a href="https://discord.gg/SlimeVR">SlimeVR Discord</a>.</p>
<p>To help with debugging in the SlimeVR Discord, you can send a recording while asking for help. A recording includes a recording of all your tracker information to help recreate your setup, and will include any movements you do, but no personally identifying information. If you are comfortable with sharing your tracker data, you can find your recordings in the server install directory under the &quot;<code>AutoBone Recordings</code>&quot; folder. The most recent recording is auto-saved as &quot;<code>LastABRecording.pfr</code>&quot; and any manually saved recordings will be &quot;<code>ABRecording1.pfr</code>&quot;, &quot;<code>ABRecording2.pfr</code>&quot;, etc., with the highest number being the most recent.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-works"><a class="header" href="#how-it-works">How it Works</a></h3>
<p>AutoBone works by recording movement data and simulating that movement rapidly while gradually adjusting the bone lengths. When adjusting bone lengths, the algorithm measures the amount the feet slide to know whether it's achieving a better or worse outcome with each adjustment. By iterating over the data multiple times, the algorithm is able to obtain reasonable bone length values with minimal foot sliding.</p>
<p>The AutoBone algorithm uses classic machine learning technique called <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization" title="Wikipedia - In machine learning, hyperparameter optimization or tuning is the problem of choosing a set of optimal hyperparameters for a learning algorithm.">hyperparameter optimization</a> to acquire the bone length values. First, many samples of movement data are recorded, then using <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization" title="Wikipedia - In machine learning, hyperparameter optimization or tuning is the problem of choosing a set of optimal hyperparameters for a learning algorithm.">hyperparameter optimization</a>, the algorithm gradually adjusts the bone lengths to minimize the error of foot sliding. Error is calculated through multiple different methods, but generally it is formulated to retain the headset's reported height, &quot;average&quot; human body proportionality, and reduce the amount that the feet slide during movement.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-a-reset"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-reset">What is a Reset?</a></h1>
<p>A reset is the action of resetting the slimeVR skeleton model to a default pose.
This is needed to mitigate any drift you may experience overtime.
You have the option of reset or fast reset, whichever you use depends on your situation.
Reset will do a full reset where by you have to stand straight, look forward and reset (with standard 6 point tracking it is not required to t-pose).
A fast reset is used to clear drift, and only resets the axis along which drift occurs.
Now that you know what a reset is, let's set up a fast way to trigger these resets!</p>
<h1 id="which-reset-type-to-use"><a class="header" href="#which-reset-type-to-use">Which Reset Type to Use?</a></h1>
<p>The type of reset is completely dependent on your position or circumstances.</p>
<h2 id="reset"><a class="header" href="#reset">Reset:</a></h2>
<p>A standard reset is used to completely restore your skeleton model to it's default pose.
This is done by standing up straight, looking forward and performing the reset.
This can only works as intended when standing up.</p>
<h2 id="fast-reset"><a class="header" href="#fast-reset">Fast Reset</a></h2>
<p>A fast reset only resets/corrects for any potential drift on one axis.
Whilst less accurate this allows you to reset whilst sitting/laying down.
It is recommended to straighten your limbs and look forward whilst doing this for optimal results.
This method makes it possible to not have to get up every time you have to reset.</p>
<h1 id="feeder-app"><a class="header" href="#feeder-app">Feeder App</a></h1>
<p>To set up reset bindings for SlimeVR you can use the <a href="https://github.com/SlimeVR/SlimeVR-Feeder-App">feeder-app</a>, which is included by default in the SlimeVR-Installer version 0.1.5 and up.
If you are running an outdated version of SlimeVR without the feeder app, you can download the <a href="https://slimevr.dev/download">latest version</a> and install it.
This makes setting up reset bindings a lot easier.
You can use the included video for a visual guide on how to set up the reset bindings.</p>
<h2 id="setup"><a class="header" href="#setup">Setup</a></h2>
<p>To set up reset bindings using the feeder-app you do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Head over to your SteamVR settings (make sure &quot;Advanced Settings&quot; is enabled).</li>
<li>Go to Controllers &gt; &quot;Show old binding UI&quot; &gt; &quot;show more applications&quot;.</li>
<li>Scroll down and select &quot;SlimeVR-Feeder-App&quot;.</li>
<li>Pick a button on your controller to use for the reset binding.</li>
<li>Now you can set up a key combination or behavior to perform: &quot;Reset&quot; or &quot;Fast Reset&quot;. (see video for clarification)</li>
</ol>
<p>And you're done!
You're now all set up to have blazingly fast resets.
<em>Fastest reset in the west</em>.</p>
<p>You can set this up in whatever way works for you!
Most people opt for either a double tap, long press or button combinations/chords.
This choice is totally up to you.</p>

<h1 id="keyboard-shortcuts"><a class="header" href="#keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard Shortcuts</a></h1>
<p>The SlimeVR Server has the following default key bindings:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+U</code> for Quick reset.</li>
<li><code>CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+Y</code> for Reset.</li>
</ul>
<p>These keybindings can be configured by editing the following line of the <code>vrconfig.yml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">keybindings: {reset: CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+Y, quickReset: CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+U}
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to be able to bind these to your controller, you will need an additional application such as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1009850/OVR_Advanced_Settings/">OVR Advanced Settings</a> (Free) or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1068820/OVR_Toolkit/">OVR Toolkit</a> (Paid, $12 USD).</p>
<h3 id="ovr-advanced-settings-bindings"><a class="header" href="#ovr-advanced-settings-bindings">OVR Advanced Settings Bindings</a></h3>
<p>Make sure OVR Advanced Settings is closed before following these steps or you will encounter problems.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the Windows Explorer window, enter <code>%appdata%/AdvancedSettings-Team/OVR Advanced Settings.ini</code> in <strong>Address bar</strong> and press Enter. Notepad with the <code>OVR Advanced Settings.ini</code> file contents should open.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find the <code>keyboardOne</code> and <code>keyboardTwo</code> lines and replace them with the following lines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ini">keyboardOne=^*&gt;y ; CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+Y - Reset
keyboardTwo=^*&gt;u ; CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+U - Quick reset
</code></pre>

<h3 id="ovr-toolkit"><a class="header" href="#ovr-toolkit">OVR Toolkit</a></h3>
<p>If you do not wish to bind keyboard shortcuts directly to your controller buttons, OVR Toolkit's &quot;wristwatch&quot; has Macro functionality that can be used to trigger Resets and Quick Resets.</p>
<p>Demo GIF:</p>
<p><img src="server/../assets/img/ovrtDemo.gif" alt="img" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Open the OVR Toolkit settings. It may be in the <a href="server/../assets/img/ovrtTray.webp">system tray.</a></li>
<li>Click on &quot;Settings&quot; on the top, then &quot;Setup Wrist Macros&quot; on the right.</li>
<li>Click on &quot;Macro Icons&quot; at the bottom, this will open a folder that you can place PNGs for custom macro icons. Download and copy these two icon files for the resets into there. <a href="server/../assets/img/resetBold.png">Reset Icon.</a> <a href="server/../assets/img/quickresetBold.png">Quick Reset Icon.</a></li>
<li>Close and re-open OVR Toolkit, otherwise the icons won't show up yet.</li>
<li>Click &quot;Add Macro&quot;, and click &quot;Add key press&quot; until you have enough for each key of the binding. (Default needs 4).</li>
<li>For each key in sequence, click &quot;Rebind&quot; and then push one of the binding's buttons once. Having the letter as the bottom key is important, as that is the order the keys are pressed. Entering <code>Y+CTRL+ALT+SHIFT</code> would not work, but <code>CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+Y</code> would.</li>
<li>Click the blank icon square on the left side of the entry, and choose the corresponding icon. (To differentiate, Reset is the basic reset symbol. Quick Reset has the flame in the middle.)</li>
<li>Repeat steps 5-7 for the other binding.</li>
<li>Click &quot;Save Changes&quot;, and then check the Macros tab on your OVR Toolkit wristwatch for your new bindings! (You may need to restart OVR Toolkit!)</li>
</ol>
<p>Example GIF of adding the Quick Reset binding:</p>
<p><img src="server/../assets/img/ovrtMacro.gif" alt="img" /></p>
<h4 id="warning"><a class="header" href="#warning">Warning</a></h4>
<p>Currently the SlimeVR server resets the positions the instant the binding is pressed, which is not ideal if you are looking down at your extended arms. However, this can be overcome with a simple AutoHotKey script until a configuration option is added to add a countdown to those bindings. Save this script with a <code>.ahk</code> extension.</p>
<p>If you want this script to also start up with Windows, right click it, Create Shortcut, and copy that shortcut to <code>C:/Users/&lt;YourUsername&gt;/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup</code></p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="osc"><a class="header" href="#osc">OSC</a></h1>
<p>OSC stands for Open Sound Control. It was originally developed to be used to connect and control music equipment in a simple, open, and standard way. VRChat developed a system for it to be used to control the avatar and virtual trackers, allowing for fully body tracking on Quest 2. You can read the VRChat documentation on it <a href="https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/osc-overview">here</a>.</p>
<h1 id="osc-setup"><a class="header" href="#osc-setup">OSC Setup</a></h1>
<p>Once you have set up your trackers and mounted them correctly, you can set up OSC. In the SlimeVR Server, navigate to Settings &gt; OSC &gt; VRChat and enable OSC. If the server is <a href="server/../tools/termux-installation.html">running on the Quest</a>, leave the address as 127.0.0.1. If the server is not on the Quest, put in your Quest's IP. You can get this by opening the Quick Settings menu on your Quest, selecting Wifi, your currently connected network, and scroll down and click the arrow. The IP address is listed there (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gL1vgWubcJw">video tutorial on how to find your Quest's IP</a>).</p>
<p>Now that you have the SlimeVR side set up, you can now connect VRChat to SlimeVR.</p>
<p><strong>If SlimeVR is running on your Quest, press reset now!</strong></p>
<p>Open VRChat on your Quest.</p>
<p>Using the Radial Menu, select Options at the top, OSC, and then enable it.
You can verify that the trackers are being seen by VRChat by selecting &quot;OSC Debug&quot; if you like.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/737888/154179201-ec413948-7013-494a-81fb-4b5e1129cf5f.jpg" alt="img" /></p>
<p>Walk over to a mirror, open the quick menu, and press &quot;Calibrate FBT&quot;. Make a T-Pose, lining yourself up with the T-Pose in the mirror. Press reset on the server (unless you're running it on your Quest). Pull both triggers, and you're done!</p>
<p>Note: If SlimeVR is running on your Quest and the trackers are initially misaligned, you can navigate to the IK settings in VRChat's quick menu and press &quot;Auto-Center OSC Trackers&quot; once or twice.</p>

<p>This error indicates there is interference between your computer and the tracker. Check the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure your USB cable from the tracker is plugged firmly into your PC.</li>
<li>Make sure that your USB cable is a data and charging cable (it is suggested you try other cables or devices with the cable).</li>
<li>Make sure that your drivers are up to date.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, this can be caused by software hogging COM ports (<strong>VSCode and Cura can be the cause of this</strong>).</p>
<h2 id="the-slimevr-server-wont-start"><a class="header" href="#the-slimevr-server-wont-start">The SlimeVR Server won't start</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>If there's a port error, make sure you don't have other instances of the server running and/or restart your PC.</li>
<li>This may also be caused by Java not being installed or issues with your Java installation. The installer linked in the <a href="server/initial-setup.html#install-the-latest-slimevr-installer">Installing the server page</a> should handle this.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-wi-fi-settings-window-outputs-error-the-wifi-settings-window-outputs-error"><a class="header" href="#the-wi-fi-settings-window-outputs-error-the-wifi-settings-window-outputs-error">The Wi-Fi Settings window outputs ERROR {#the-wifi-settings-window-outputs-error}</a></h2>
<p>Try resetting your tracker, this may fix the issues immediately. If this doesn't work, your COM port may be being hogged, which can be tested by going through the firmware update process in VSCode (as it has more verbose error messages). If this is the case, close any application that might be hogging the ports (VSCode and Cura are often the cause). If the issue persists, try connecting the tracker to a different USB port.</p>
<h2 id="the-wi-fi-settings-window-outputs-symbols-and-nothing-else-the-wifi-settings-window-outputs-symbols-and-nothing-else"><a class="header" href="#the-wi-fi-settings-window-outputs-symbols-and-nothing-else-the-wifi-settings-window-outputs-symbols-and-nothing-else">The Wi-Fi Settings window outputs symbols and nothing else {#the-wifi-settings-window-outputs-symbols-and-nothing-else}</a></h2>
<p>There are two common causes that you should check:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you have the right driver installed.</li>
<li>Check that your PIO firmware upload worked. If you have multiple firmware versions open in VSCode you will have to set the correct one to default to upload.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-tracker-keeps-flashing"><a class="header" href="#my-tracker-keeps-flashing">My tracker keeps flashing</a></h2>
<p>This is intended behavior, the number of flashes lets you know the current status of your tracker. Check the top of the <a href="server-setup/initial-setup.html#test-your-trackers">the setup page for more info</a>.</p>
<h2 id="my-tracker-never-connects-to-wi-fi--are-not-appearing-on-the-slimevr-server"><a class="header" href="#my-tracker-never-connects-to-wi-fi--are-not-appearing-on-the-slimevr-server">My tracker never connects to Wi-Fi / are not appearing on the SlimeVR Server</a></h2>
<p>The two common issues that cause this error are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you are connecting to a 2.4GHz network, 5GHz networks are not supported.</li>
<li>Check your SSID for special characters. At the time of writing SlimeVR only supports network SSIDs that contain alphanumerical characters.</li>
</ul>
<p>If all of this is correct, you can check your gateway's list of connected devices to see if all your trackers are connecting. If a tracker is not connecting even after using the same firmware upload with hardcoded Wi-Fi details there are two additional steps you can check:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check if your Wi-Fi has reached it's maximum allowed Wi-Fi connections. You can test this by disconnecting devices and then trying to connect your trackers again.</li>
<li>If you hard coded your Wi-Fi settings in <code>platformio.ini</code> try connecting your trackers via usb and <a href="server/connecting-trackers.html#connect-trackers">pushing new Wi-Fi details</a>. You may find this either fixes your connection or provides you with additional details on why the connection is failing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-aux-tracker-isnt-working"><a class="header" href="#my-aux-tracker-isnt-working">My aux tracker isn't working</a></h2>
<p>In order to make sure your aux tracker is set up, you need to specify it in your <code>defines.h</code> uploaded to the primary tracker's firmware. Check the <a href="firmware/configuring-project.html#define-pins-of-the-selected-board">bottom of the section mentioning defining the pins on the configuring the SlimeVR firmware page</a>. Alternatively, you should ensure that you have correctly soldered VCC to AD0 on your aux tracker IMU.</p>
<h2 id="sensor-was-reset-error"><a class="header" href="#sensor-was-reset-error">Sensor was reset error</a></h2>
<p>Check your INT wire, there is either a bad connection or you have it connected to the flash pin. If you are building your tracker on a breadboard, your connections may be not firm enough and cause this error.</p>
<h2 id="the-trackers-are-connected-to-my-wi-fi-but-dont-turn-up-on-slimevr-the-trackers-are-connected-to-my-wifi-but-dont-turn-up-on-slimevr"><a class="header" href="#the-trackers-are-connected-to-my-wi-fi-but-dont-turn-up-on-slimevr-the-trackers-are-connected-to-my-wifi-but-dont-turn-up-on-slimevr">The trackers are connected to my Wi-Fi but don't turn up on SlimeVR {#the-trackers-are-connected-to-my-wifi-but-dont-turn-up-on-slimevr}</a></h2>
<p>Check that you do not have two copies of the SlimeVR server running, as only one of them will show trackers connected.</p>
<p>If only one server is running, this is most likely a firewall issue, go to SlimeVR Server folder and run <code>firewall.bat</code> as administrator to add the firewall rules to Windows Defender Firewall.</p>
<p>If you are still having trouble, try manually adding the SlimeVR Server to your firewall.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Network &amp; Internet</strong> then click on the text link <strong>Window Firewall</strong> (you may have to scroll down).</li>
<li>In the firewall window, click the link <strong>Allow an app through firewall</strong>.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Allow another app...</strong> button, and then <strong>Browse...</strong> in the opened <strong>Add an app</strong> window. If your options are greyed out in the <strong>Allowed apps</strong> window, click the <strong>Change Settings</strong> button to allow changes.</li>
<li>In the <strong>File name</strong> text box, type <code>*.*</code> and press enter before navigating to <code>slimevr.jar</code> in your SlimeVR server folder and select it (if you cannot see files in this folder, try typing <code>*.*</code> and pressing enter again to show all files).</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Add</strong> button to add the file to your firewall settings.</li>
<li>Finally, make sure both public and private check boxes are selected in the <strong>Allowed apps</strong> window before clicking <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>If adding SlimeVR to your firewall has not worked, you can try to diagnose the issue further with the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Try completely disabling Windows Defender Firewall on your computer temporarily to test if the trackers will connect.
<ul>
<li>If the trackers only show up on SlimeVR when Windows Defender Firewall is disabled, then you have a problem with your firewall.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Try pinging the tracker from your computer to see if it can be reached by opening Command Prompt (CMD) and run the command <code>ping &lt;IP&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;IP&gt;</code> is your tracker's IP (ex. <code>ping 192.168.0.1</code>). You can find the tracker's IP using the &quot;Serial console&quot; under the &quot;Settings&quot; tab of the SlimeVR GUI.
<ul>
<li>If the command outputs something like <code>Reply from 192.168.XXX.XXX: Destination host unreachable.</code>, then you likely have a problem with either your router or your firewall.</li>
<li>If the command outputs something like <code>Reply from 192.168.XXX.XXX: bytes=32 time&lt;1ms TTL=63</code>, then you likely have a problem with either your network adapter or your network settings. You may need to enable broadcast packets (or something similar) on your router, as SlimeVR trackers broadcast to <code>255.255.255.255</code> to discover your SlimeVR Server.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Try hosting a Wi-Fi hotspot either from your computer or your phone and connect your trackers to it to see if they will show up on SlimeVR using it.
<ul>
<li>If the trackers don't show up on SlimeVR, then you likely have a problem with either your trackers or your computer. It may be worth trying disabling your Windows Defender Firewall as per the first step, but using this Wi-Fi hotspot instead.</li>
<li>If the trackers show up on SlimeVR, then you likely have a problem with either your router or the network adapter you connect to your router with.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This is usually the result of an issue with the IMU. Plug in your Wemos D1 Mini and check through the serial console under settings in the SlimeVR server. You may see an error like one of the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">[ERR] I2C: Can't find I2C device on provided addresses, scanning for all I2C devices and returning
[ERR] I2C: No I2C devices found
[ERR] I2C: Can't find I2C device on provided addresses, scanning for all I2C devices and returning
[DBG] I2C (@ D2(4) : D1(5)): I2C device found at address 0x68  !
[ERROR] [ErroneousSensor:0] IMU of type MPU6500 failed to initialize
</code></pre>
<p>The most common reasons for errors with the IMU are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>You accidentally set the IMU wrong (i.e. set as MPU6050 when you have an BNO085)</li>
<li>You accidentally selected the wrong board type (i.e. set as BOARD_SLIMEVR instead of BOARD_WEMOSD1MINI)</li>
<li>The wiring is wrong (e.g. accidentally swapping around D1/D2 and SDA/SCL)</li>
<li>There's an issue with the soldering (e.g. not enough solder, cold joint, or bridging between SDA and SCL)</li>
<li>You're using a breadboard (Without soldering connections, the IMU often won't be able to communicate with the microcontroller)</li>
<li>There's an issue with the IMU itself (e.g. burned trace while soldering, or the chip is downright DOA)</li>

<p>So you want to build your own SlimeVR trackers?</p>
<h2 id="the-process"><a class="header" href="#the-process">The Process</a></h2>
<p>Once you know how many you need, it's time to get started:</p>
<p><strong>1. Source the Components</strong></p>
<p>You'll need to purchase the parts required to put the project together. You can find a guide for that on our <a href="diy/components-guide.html">components guide page</a>. There are a handful of choices you can make during this step, it is suggested you read the guide through to get an idea of what each part does. Please note that the documentation on this page is assuming you are using the most common microcontroller used for this project, the Wemos D1 Mini. You can use a different microcontroller with the required specifications, however the documentation on other microcontrollers is not as comprehensive.</p>
<p><strong>2. Print / Buy a Case</strong></p>
<p>Many DIYers use tupperware, Tictac or jiffy boxes, however the community has created a handful of <a href="diy/cases.html">files for 3D printing</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. Assemble Your Trackers</strong></p>
<p>Refer to our <a href="diy/tracker-schematics.html">tracker schematics page</a>. Enter the information for your sourced parts and use the resulting image to solder your trackers together. We are currently working on a more in-depth breakdown of this process.
For a quick guide to soldering, please refer to this video:</p>
<div class="video-container">
<iframe width="100%" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P0YX_eKyfxA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p><strong>Quick Tips!</strong></p>
<p>Most cheap soldering irons come with a roll of solder included.
However most of the time this is leaded fluxless solder of very poor quality.
Ideally you want some unleaded rosin core solder for the best and safest results.
Leaded is possible but not adviced.</p>
<p>Tin the tip of your new soldering iron before the first use (and between uses).
All you have to do is heat up the soldering iron and generously add solder to the tip.
Then wipe the tip on a wet sponge or in the copper/steelwool (or whatever your soldering iron came with).
This will coat the tip and keep it fresh and working optimally.</p>
<p><strong>4. Upload the Firmware</strong></p>
<p>Download the firmware from our github, define what boards you have put in your tracker and how they are set up, and then upload it to the newly built trackers. You can find a full breakdown of this process in the <a href="diy/../firmware/updating-firmware.html">uploading the firmware guide</a>.</p>
<p><strong>5. Install and set up the SlimeVR Server</strong></p>
<p>This final step requires you to install and configure your server, allowing the tracking data to be parsed on your local machine. After doing so, all that's left is to configure tracker roles and you are ready to go! The steps to do all this can be found on our <a href="diy/../server-setup/slimevr-setup.html">SlimeVR Server setup page</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong>: BNO085s are very difficult to attain at reasonable prices with the current chip shortage. If you are trying to use these boards in particular, the above price guide may differ <strong>wildly</strong> from what you should expect, and <em>moreover</em> differ greatly from what they're actually worth. If you do happen to find BNO085s for sale elsewhere, such as on Alibaba, it's unlikely they will actually have any in stock. If they do, it's likely that they will quote an exorbitant and unrealistic price such as $120 per IMU. Adafruit BNO085s are the only reputable and regularly in stock option for BNO085s.</p>
<h2 id="component-breakdown"><a class="header" href="#component-breakdown">Component Breakdown</a></h2>
<p>A complete set of SlimeVR trackers can be made from around $70 to $250, depending on what you have at home already and your choice of parts.</p>
<p>One of the most impactful choices you make is what type of IMU (Inertial measurement unit) you use, which will determine the price point as well as the quality of the tracking.</p>
<p>Another important consideration is where you buy your components. This guide will use costs from AliExpress, which is where most of us buy our components from due to both price and availability. Unfortunately the shipping times from there are quite long, with many orders taking between 3-6 weeks to arrive. You can also buy from Amazon or other local retailers, but pricing will vary wildly.</p>
<p>When it comes to purchasing components it's also prudent to get a few extras in case any come faulty, or if you accidentally break one along the way. If you plan on ordering from AliExpress where the shipping times are quite long, take note -- ordering an exact amount of the parts needed and having one or two components die could mean a long wait before getting replacements. Generally speaking, IMUs are the component most likely to have break or to come broken, so plan accordingly. Wemos D1 Minis and TP4056 charging boards are fairly reliable, but a few extra is worth considering.</p>

<h3 id="wemos-d1-mini"><a class="header" href="#wemos-d1-mini">Wemos D1 Mini</a></h3>
<p>The Wemos D1 Mini is an ESP8266 dev board, it's basically a small computer which handles the thinking and WiFi connection. You can use a different microcontroller with the required specifications, however the documentation on other microcontrollers is not as comprehensive. If you decide to do this, please check the #diy channel in our <a href="https://discord.gg/SlimeVR">Discord</a> for more information.</p>
<p>There are multiple variants of the D1 Mini, some better than others. The main variants you should look at purchasing would be the CH340, V3.0, and V4.0. There are, however, variants you should avoid. These would be the FT232, and Pro variants. The FT232 variant may have USB connectivity issues due to fake FT232 chips, and the Pro variant has a design flaw with its antenna that necessitates having an external antenna.</p>
<h3 id="imu-inertial-measurement-unit"><a class="header" href="#imu-inertial-measurement-unit">IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)</a></h3>
<p>SlimeVR uses several IMUs in order to determine your pose. There are a handful of options available which you can read about more on the <a href="diy/imu-comparison.html">IMU Comparison page</a>.</p>
<h3 id="batteries"><a class="header" href="#batteries">Batteries</a></h3>
<p>There are many different options for batteries, and the size you go with will generally determine the size of the case you will need. You will need one battery per Wemos D1 Mini. As far as battery life is concerned, every 100 mAh a battery is rated for will last for 1 hour of use. So, a 1200 mAh battery will generally last around 12 hours of continuous use.</p>
<p>Flat Li-Po batteries are generally fairly truthful about their capacity, however, 18650s can greatly vary in capacity depending on manufacturer. A generic no-name 18650 could be as low in capacity as 800 mAh, whereas an 18650 made by a reputable manufacturer like LG, Samsung, or Sony may have as high capacity at 3500 mAh. In general, be suspicious of claimed 18650 capacity.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that not all batteries are created equal. Some will have protection circuitry and some will not. Generally speaking, flat Li-Po batteries will usually have protection circuitry, whereas battery such as 18650s will not. If you're planning on getting flat Li-Po batteries, the protection circuitry will usually look like a small PCB with a few chips on it, beneath the yellow polyimide tape on the battery. That being said, the <a href="diy/components-guide.html#charging-board---tp4056">TP4056 charging board</a> will provide these same features so lack of battery protection shouldn't be a make or break factor, but rather additional peace of mind and added safety.</p>
<h3 id="charging-board---tp4056"><a class="header" href="#charging-board---tp4056">Charging Board - TP4056</a></h3>
<p>To charge your batteries, you need to get a charge controller to make sure the batteries are safely charged. Bear in mind, without diodes, you can potentially damage your battery if you accidentally leave your tracker on while charging. That being said, the TP4056 charging boards also provide some safety features such as over-discharge protection, over-charging protection (only when turned off if you don't have <a href="diy/components-guide.html#diodes-optional">diodes</a>!), short circuit protection, and over current protection.</p>
<h3 id="power-switches"><a class="header" href="#power-switches">Power Switches</a></h3>
<p>You want to be able to shut off your SlimeVR trackers, to conserve battery, and prevent unnecessary charge cycles that will reduce the lifetime of the battery. These are also important as you should not charge the trackers while they are on.</p>
<h3 id="diodes-optional"><a class="header" href="#diodes-optional">Diodes (Optional)</a></h3>
<p>A pair of diodes act as an added safety measure that allow the tracker to be used while charging and protect against accidental damage due to over-charging if accidentally left powered on.</p>
<h3 id="resistors-optional"><a class="header" href="#resistors-optional">Resistors (Optional)</a></h3>
<p>With a &quot;Battery sense&quot; resistor you can check the battery percentage in the server. Without this, you will only know when your tracker is close to dying, as the Wemos D1 Mini will rapidly blink when the battery is very low. Resistor values from ~100K ohm to ~220K ohm can be used, however there may be a loss in precision when reporting battery level. Using a resistor value other than 180K will mean needing to change the resistor value in firmware.</p>
<h3 id="wiring"><a class="header" href="#wiring">Wiring</a></h3>
<p>To connect your various components together will require some wiring. It is generally recommended to use 26AWG stranded wiring. If you're thrifty you can salvage the wires out of various disused cables you might have, such as VGA cables, ethernet, or USB.</p>
<p>Additionally, as an added convenience if you plan on making any extensions, you may want to add connectors so you can have removable extensions. Various types of connectors can be used, but the most commonly used are 5 pin JST connectors. Others have also used RJ45 ethernet connectors, and USB C.</p>
<h3 id="cases"><a class="header" href="#cases">Cases</a></h3>
<p>Choosing or designing a case is where you will have the most freedom to choose whatever you like. If you have access to a 3d printer you can print some cases for ~$10 worth of filament. There are some great <a href="diy/cases.html">Community-built cases</a>, likewise it's worth checking the #diy and #cases channels of our <a href="https://discord.gg/SlimeVR">Discord</a>. There's also the option of buying a small plastic case to fit all of your components. Make sure to check dimensions on both pre-bought and 3D printed cases so that it fits your chosen components.</p>
<h3 id="straps"><a class="header" href="#straps">Straps</a></h3>
<p>Straps are another area where you have a lot of liberty to try whatever works best for you. The go-to recommendation is to use elastic straps with velcro. Elastic straps are the go-to recommendation because they will stretch and should stay in place however you move. Nylon straps, while technically usable, are fairly inflexible will tend to slide as you move, making them less suitable. Generally speaking, you will want straps that are at least 38mm or 1.5 inches wide, going any smaller will result in less stable mounting.</p>
<p>When it comes to mounting, you may find that there are not any straps long enough to go around your torso -- in this case, two straps with velcro can be chained together to make one longer strap. Another option for the chest in particular is to use a GoPro chest mount, which can improve stability greatly if you find your chest trackers tend to slide. Also, its worth mentioning that you may want different sized straps depending on where each tracker is going to go, such as having shorter straps for thigh trackers than ankle trackers. Be sure to measure yourself with a tape measure if you're going to go this route! It's worth noting that <em>elastic stretches</em> so if you find straps that seem just a bit too small, they may stretch an additional 50mm or so or more depending on length.</p>
<p>For ideas on making your own custom straps, consider viewing the <a href="diy/diy-straps.html">DIY Straps Guide</a>.</p>
<h3 id="tools"><a class="header" href="#tools">Tools</a></h3>
<p>You will also need some tools to be able to put together a tracker. You might have these already or have a friend or a maker space nearby where you can borrow these:</p>
<ul>
<li>A soldering iron, solder, and solder flux.</li>
<li>A wire cutter.</li>
<li>A soldering third hand</li>
<li>(Optional) A multimeter to check your connections.</li>
<li>(Optional) A solder sucker or desoldering braid. To more easily be able to fix mistakes when soldering.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note: ensure you do not buy solder intended for soldering plumbing fixtures. This type of solder is more acidic and may corrode PCBs and electronic components.</p>
<p>If you haven't done a DIY project like this, look up some soldering tutorials on YouTube and feel free to ask questions in the #diy channel in our <a href="https://discord.gg/SlimeVR">Discord</a>.</p>

<p>The community has been hard at work testing various IMUs for DIY SlimeVR trackers.
A survey was held within the DIY community for a clearer picture of the current state of available IMUs.
This page is based on user feedback and weighed against the survey, with scores showing the average answer given to the chip.
Following completing your own trackers, you can complete an extended version of that original survey yourself, or view previous responses on the <a href="diy/../misc/survey.html">SlimeVR Experience Survey page</a>.</p>

GY-912 (Please note this board requires you to bridge SD0 to GND to change the address)</p>
<p>CJMCU-20948 is known to run on 1.8v and needs additional hardware to work.
A 1.8v Linear Voltage regulator and Logic Level Converter is needed and as such this board is not recommended.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-difference-between-an-imu-with-a-magnetometer-9-dof-and-an-imu-without-a-magnetometer-6-dof"><a class="header" href="#whats-the-difference-between-an-imu-with-a-magnetometer-9-dof-and-an-imu-without-a-magnetometer-6-dof">What's the difference between an IMU with a magnetometer (9 DOF) and an IMU without a magnetometer (6 DOF)?</a></h2>
<p>IMUs with a magnetometer work like a compass and use the Earths magnetic field as a reference point to eliminate gyroscope drift, however they require a stable magnetic environment or else they will perform erratically. IMUs without a magnetometer don't require a stable magnetic environment, but are prone to gyroscope drift over time due to being unable to differentiate sensor noise from actual movement and so will slowly spin in the yaw axis over time. For SlimeVR's purposes neither is implicitly better or worse than the other. The BNO085, which is the IMU official SlimeVR trackers will use, is used in 6DOF mode and yet performs the best out of all supported IMUs, for example.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-check-if-i-have-an-acceptable-magnetic-environment"><a class="header" href="#how-can-i-check-if-i-have-an-acceptable-magnetic-environment">How can I check if I have an acceptable magnetic environment?</a></h2>
<p>You can check by downloading any magnetometer app that shows what your magnetic field strength is in uT and by walking around your playspace. You may want to check at varying heights, such as at chest level, waist level, and ankle level. An option available on both iOS and Android is the app, Physics Toolbox Magnetometer. If you do use Physics Toolbox Magnetometer, you only need to pay attention to the <strong>total</strong>, not the X, Y, or Z components. Most phones have a magnetometer, but if yours does not, then there is no way to be exactly sure of your magnetic environment, but you can make some educated assumptions.</p>
<h2 id="my-app-show-around-x-ut-is-that-okay"><a class="header" href="#my-app-show-around-x-ut-is-that-okay">My app show around X uT is that okay?</a></h2>
<p>There's no one value that's acceptable. What matters is that the range of values is low. There is currently limited data to give an exact range, but a good baseline seems to be a range of less than or equal to 5 uT. For example, 20-25 uT would be okay as would 40-45 uT, but a range from 20-40 uT would likely be too unstable to use.</p>
<h2 id="what-determines-a-poor-magnetic-environment"><a class="header" href="#what-determines-a-poor-magnetic-environment">What determines a &quot;poor magnetic environment&quot;?</a></h2>
<p>Often things made of steel or other ferromagnetic materials contribute most to a poor magnetic environment. Some common examples of things that might affect your magnetic environment include, but are not limited to: spring mattresses, radiators, PC cases, desktop speakers, or furniture that's made of steel. In most cases, the effect that these things will have extend about 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) and within that range may cause the IMU to rotate incorrectly. The size and amount of mass directly impacts the size of the effected area; a paper clip might only affect your IMU if it's directly next to it, whereas a steel bedframe might affect an area 6-12 inches (15-30 cm) away as previous mentioned. In most cases, depending on the size of your playspace, these issues of certain objects causing interference can be mitigated by avoiding or reposition them. Regardless, other factors such as the wiring or rebar in your building could also affect your magnetic environment. These last few examples are harder to predict and illustrate why it's important to test with an app before assuming you might have a stable magnetic environment.</p>
<p>It's also worth mentioning that some controllers have magnets in them, either to hold the battery door closed or for the trigger. As such, placing your controller near a tracker with a magnetometer may cause it to spin slightly.</p>
<h2 id="does-magnetic-interference-cause-drift"><a class="header" href="#does-magnetic-interference-cause-drift">Does magnetic interference cause drift?</a></h2>
<p>No, but you may still need to reset. When in an area of magnetic interference an IMU with a magnetometer will reorient itself the same way a compass will when put near a magnet; if you take the magnet away from the compass, the compass will return pointing towards magnetic North. As mentioned though, you may still find yourself needing to reset. For instance, if your bed has a steel bedframe you'll likely need to perform a reset so that your trackers are facing the correct direction. If you then move somewhere else within your playspace you'll likely then need to reset once again.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-still-use-my-imu-with-a-magnetometer-if-i-dont-have-a-stable-magnetic-environment"><a class="header" href="#can-i-still-use-my-imu-with-a-magnetometer-if-i-dont-have-a-stable-magnetic-environment">Can I still use my IMU with a magnetometer if I don't have a stable magnetic environment?</a></h2>
<p>This cannot be recommended. When run without the magnetometer, IMUs with magnetometers such as the MPU9250 and ICM20948, perform much worse. That said, if for whatever reason you do want to use your IMU without the magnetometer, the MPU6500 or MPU6050 firmware can be used on the MPU9250 instead, and the ICM20948 can run in 6DOF mode.</p>
<h2 id="imu-calibration-1"><a class="header" href="#imu-calibration-1">IMU Calibration</a></h2>
<p>Some IMUs, such as the MPU9250, BMI160, and MPU+QMC5883L, require manual calibration. This only needs to be performed once upon first setting up your SlimeVR tracker, however, you may need to perform the calibration multiple times before reaching satisfactory results. More information on how you would calibrate your IMUs can be <a href="diy/../server-setup/initial-setup.html#imu-calibration">found here.</a></p>

<p><em>This page is not a definitive/step by step guide to straps.</em>
<em>This page is meant to be used as inspiration to make your own DIY straps.</em>
<em>All examples on this page are community made/provided.</em></p>
<h2 id="tom-yums"><a class="header" href="#tom-yums">Tom Yum's</a></h2>
<p>Tom Yum wanted to prevent his straps from sliding. He opted to directly sew the velcro and use it as the main mounting system, he also chose to mount the trackers using velcro instead of loops to eliminate skin contact with all the parts other than the elastic bands.</p>
<p>These straps require the following materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>105mm Elastic band</li>
<li>40mm Elastic band</li>
<li>20mm Elastic band</li>
<li>Velcro Strips (Non-adhesive)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="diy/../assets/img/TomYumStraps.jpg" alt="TomYum Straps" /></p>
<h2 id="fadetoblk27s"><a class="header" href="#fadetoblk27s">Fadetoblk27's</a></h2>
<p>Fadetoblk27 took an approach that does not require sewing (sewing can be done for added strength).
This is achieved by using slider buckles.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/931410740320026654/966128713685159967/IMG_0095.jpg" alt="img" /></p>
<p>Materials used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elastic band 50mm</li>
<li>50mm Buckles</li>
<li>50mm Slider Buckles</li>
</ul>
<p>Instructions:
Cut a strip of material to length by wrapping it around the desired body part.
Weave the strap through the normal buckle on both ends and instead of sewing the ends, weave them through the slider buckles (as seen in the picture).
This allows the straps to be very adjustable and require no sewing.
Sewing can still be done if the added strength/stability is desired.</p>
<h2 id="smelties"><a class="header" href="#smelties">Smeltie's</a></h2>
<p>For Smelties straps the material ELA1300 was used, sadly this material isn't readily available outside of the EU and UK neighboring countries.
This material can be found at LeDuc in Europe and various UK based stores.
It is sometimes referred to as Elastic band for underwear/skirts.
You can recognize it by the lack of longitudal lines in the material (most elastic bands just have a few rubber threads along the length of the material).</p>
<p>These straps require the following materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>ELA1300 50mm Elastic band (Can be substituted)</li>
<li>Velcro strips (Preferably without adhesive)</li>
<li>50mm buckles</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="diy/../assets/img/Smeltie_strap.png" alt="smeltieimg" />
<img src="diy/../assets/img/Smeltie_strap1.png" alt="smeltieimg1" /></p>
<p>These straps have one closed end and one end with velcro.</p>
<p>Instructions:
Wrap the material around the desired body part and cut to length, keep a little extra material just in case.
Weave one end of the strap through one of the buckle halves, make it protrude just over an inch and sew it shut.
Weave the other end through the other halve of the buckle, but instead of sewing, attach a strip of velcro on either side.
Test fit your straps and ensure the correct tightness before you sew the velcro in place.
Once you have finished the strap, you can make an exact replica for the opposite side of your body.</p>
<h2 id="prevent-sliding"><a class="header" href="#prevent-sliding">Prevent Sliding</a></h2>
<p>Trackers sliding around is one of the most common issues when making your own straps.
However there are a few thing you can try to prevent/minimize this issue.</p>
<p>Things to check:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your material is too flexible.</li>
<li>Your straps are too narrow/small.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a few lines of hot glue on the strap for added grip.</li>
<li>Add straps in between the trackers to keep them in place (like Tom Yum).</li>
</ul>

<p>This procedure will show how to build and configure the SlimeVR firmware, as well as how to upload it to your tracker.</p>
<p>There are currently two ways of uploading your firmware. One is using PlatformIO, and the other is the <a href="https://slimevr-firmware-tool.futurabeast.com/">online firmware flasher</a>. The online flasher is the most user friendly but doesn't work with Safari or Firefox. The PlatformIO version is less user friendly, but is recommended if you want to get into the nitty gritty of developing the firmware.</p>
<p>If you're interested in using experimental firmware, you can use the <a href="https://slimevr-firmware.bscotch.ca/">Butterscotch online firmware flasher</a>. If you're using experimental MPU+QMC5883L trackers, or have BMI160 trackers and are interested in using experimental firmware, you can use this site to flash your trackers instead of using PlatformIO.</p>
<p>The guide assumes you have working and complete trackers, and are going to be using the platformio approach. All screenshots are for a Windows based system.</p>

<h2 id="1-configuring-platformioini"><a class="header" href="#1-configuring-platformioini">1. Configuring platformio.ini</a></h2>
<p>The <code>platformio.ini</code> file specifies the information about your MCU.</p>
<p>This file can be found in the root directory of the project:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CsBcxYL.png" alt="platformio.ini file location" /></p>
<p>The contents of <code>platformio.ini</code> file should look as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9EmR158.png" alt="platformio.ini file contents" /></p>
<h3 id="select-your-hardware-settings"><a class="header" href="#select-your-hardware-settings">Select Your Hardware Settings</a></h3>
<h4 id="monitor-speed"><a class="header" href="#monitor-speed">Monitor Speed</a></h4>
<p>This field set your serial monitor speed in VSCode <code>monitor_speed = 115200</code>. Change this if your board datasheet and documentation suggest so, but the defaults should work.</p>
<p><strong>For the platform and board fields, visit <a href="https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/boards/index.html">PlatformIO Boards documentation</a> and find your board there. If it's not there, keep default ones or ask on <a href="https://discord.gg/SlimeVR">SlimeVR Discord</a>.</strong></p>
<h4 id="env"><a class="header" href="#env">env</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Other env lines must be commented out with preceding semicolon (<code>;</code>) character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're using a board with an ESP8266, uncomment the following lines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ini">[env:esp12e]
platform = espressif8266
board = esp12e
</code></pre>
<p>If you're using a board with an ESP32, uncomment the following lines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ini">[env:esp32]
platform = espressif32
board = esp32dev
</code></pre>
<h4 id="wifi"><a class="header" href="#wifi">WiFi</a></h4>
<p>If you're having problems with setting the wifi credentials through the server, you can hardcode your wifi credentials to firmware.</p>
<p>To hardcode your wifi credentials, uncomment the following lines and replace <code>SSID</code> and <code>PASSWORD</code> with your corresponding wifi credentials:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ini">  -DWIFI_CREDS_SSID='&quot;SSID&quot;'
  -DWIFI_CREDS_PASSWD='&quot;PASSWORD&quot;'
</code></pre>
<p>If you are having problems getting the tracker to connect to your Wi-Fi, review these troubleshooting steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your wifi password contains the <code>%</code> character, replace it with <code>%%</code>.</li>
<li>If your network SSID contains non-alphanumerical characters, the tracker could fail to connect</li>
<li>The ESP8266 and ESP32 only support 2.4GHz network bands.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-configuring-definesh"><a class="header" href="#2-configuring-definesh">2. Configuring defines.h</a></h2>
<p>The <code>defines.h</code> file specifies the information about your IMU and MCU.</p>
<p>This file can be found in the <code>src</code> directory of the project:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KlAq8tT.png" alt="defines.h file location" /></p>
<p>You can either edit the defines.h file <a href="firmware/configuring-project.html#configuring-definesh-manually">manually</a> or use the tool below to generate the contents of the file.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-definesh-automatically"><a class="header" href="#configuring-definesh-automatically">Configuring defines.h Automatically</a></h3>
<p>Select how you built your SlimeVR tracker:</p>

<p>After selecting the settings above, you can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the download button below and replace your defines.h file.</li>
<li>Copy and paste from the text field below into your IDE (such as VSCode).</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="btn btn-purple" id="defines_download">Download defines.h</a></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code id="defines_code"></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="configuring-definesh-manually"><a class="header" href="#configuring-definesh-manually">Configuring defines.h Manually</a></h3>
<p>You can also configure the defines.h file manually instead of using the tool above. Before any changes to the file, the contents of <code>defines.h</code> file should look as follows:</p>
<p><img src="firmware/../assets/img/definesEg.png" alt="defines.h file contents" /></p>
<h4 id="select-your-hardware-settings-1"><a class="header" href="#select-your-hardware-settings-1">Select Your Hardware Settings</a></h4>
<p>First you need to change these lines to define your IMU model and MCU:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">// Set parameters of IMU and board used
#define IMU IMU_BNO085
#define BOARD BOARD_SLIMEVR
#define IMU_ROTATION DEG_90
#define SECOND_IMU_ROTATION DEG_270
#define BATTERY_SHIELD_130K false
</code></pre>
<h5 id="change-the-imu-model"><a class="header" href="#change-the-imu-model">Change the IMU Model</a></h5>
<p>The following line defines which IMU is present:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define IMU IMU_BNO085
</code></pre>
<p>To change IMU model, replace <code>IMU_BNO085</code> with one of the following values depending on your IMU model:</p>
<pre><code>IMU_BNO080
IMU_BNO055
IMU_MPU9250
IMU_MPU6500
IMU_MPU6050
IMU_BNO086
IMU_ICM20948
IMU_BMI160
</code></pre>
<p>If you're using an MPU+QMC5883L, you would set your IMU as <code>IMU_MPU9250</code>. Bear in mind, you need to be using the QMC firmware for this to work, as the main firmware does not support the MPU+QMC5883L.</p>
<h5 id="change-board-model"><a class="header" href="#change-board-model">Change Board Model</a></h5>
<p>The following line defines which MCU board is present:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define BOARD BOARD_SLIMEVR
</code></pre>
<p>To change the board model, you must replace <code>BOARD_SLIMEVR</code> with one of the possible values:</p>
<ul>
<li>For most boards with ESP8266, set it to <code>BOARD_NODEMCU</code>. For Wemos D1 Mini, you can use <code>BOARD_WEMOSD1MINI</code>.</li>
<li>For boards with ESP32, set it to <code>BOARD_WROOM32</code>.</li>
<li>For other boards that don't follow the pinouts of any defined board, set it to <code>BOARD_CUSTOM</code> and define the pins yourself.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="adjust-imu-board-rotation"><a class="header" href="#adjust-imu-board-rotation">Adjust IMU Board Rotation</a></h5>
<p>The following lines define the rotation of your IMU boards:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define IMU_ROTATION DEG_90
#define SECOND_IMU_ROTATION DEG_270
</code></pre>
<p>To change the IMU board rotation, replace <code>DEG_90</code> (and <code>DEG_270</code> if you have auxiliary IMU) with one of the following values. Top of this picture is the ceiling (or your head) and IMU facing away from you when mounted on the body.</p>
<p><img src="firmware/../assets/img/rotation.png" alt="" /></p>
<h5 id="set-battery-monitoring-options"><a class="header" href="#set-battery-monitoring-options">Set Battery Monitoring Options</a></h5>
<p>The following lines define how battery voltage is read:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define BATTERY_MONITOR BAT_EXTERNAL
#define BATTERY_SHIELD_RESISTANCE 180
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't have a 180 kOhm resistor for checking the battery percentage of your tracker, replace <code>BAT_EXTERNAL</code> with <code>BAT_INTERNAL</code>. When set to <code>BAT_INTERNAL</code> the tracker will only be able to tell when the battery is low, and will cause the LED on the microcontroller to flash repeatedly. If you have a 180 kOhm resistor you do not need to change <code>BAT_EXTERNAL</code>. If you have a resistor of value other than 180 kOhm, simply change <code>180</code> to whatever your resistor value is in kOhms, for instance <code>130</code> if your resistor is 130 kOhms. If you have a Wemos Battery Shield product, you would change <code>180</code> to <code>130</code> as previously mentioned.</p>
<h4 id="define-pins-of-the-selected-board"><a class="header" href="#define-pins-of-the-selected-board">Define Pins of the Selected Board</a></h4>
<p>You need to change only the section between <code>#elif</code> symbols with the selected board. If you are using VSCode, selected board section will light up, while other ones will be grayed out.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#elif BOARD == BOARD_NODEMCU || BOARD == BOARD_WEMOSD1MINI
  #define PIN_IMU_SDA D2
  #define PIN_IMU_SCL D1
  #define PIN_IMU_INT D5
  #define PIN_IMU_INT_2 D6
  #define PIN_BATTERY_LEVEL A0
  #define BATTERY_SHIELD_130K true
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#elif BOARD == BOARD_WROOM32
  #define PIN_IMU_SDA 21
  #define PIN_IMU_SCL 22
  #define PIN_IMU_INT 23
  #define PIN_IMU_INT_2 25
  #define PIN_BATTERY_LEVEL 36
  #define BATTERY_SHIELD_130K true
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#elif BOARD == BOARD_CUSTOM
  // Define pins by the examples above
  #define PIN_IMU_SDA 5
  #define PIN_IMU_SCL 4
  #define PIN_IMU_INT 14
  #define PIN_IMU_INT_2 13
  #define PIN_BATTERY_LEVEL A0
</code></pre>
<p>SDA and SCL pin for main and AUX trackers are always the same. You can define pins either by using pin name, like <code>D1</code>, or by pin number, like <code>21</code>. Check you board pinout for the details, or connect your tracker to the default pins, they're recommended ones.</p>
<p>You need to put here your selected pins for I2C. Check pinout for details in terms of which ports could be used for I2C.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">  #define PIN_IMU_SDA D2
  #define PIN_IMU_SCL D1
</code></pre>
<p>If you are using BNO you need to define INT pin:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">  #define PIN_IMU_INT D5
</code></pre>
<p>If you are using the second BNO you need to define INT pin for the second BNO, it must be another pin:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">  #define PIN_IMU_INT_2 D6
</code></pre>
<p>If you are using a resistor for checking the battery level, you will need to select a pin that supports analog input:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">  #define PIN_BATTERY_LEVEL A0
</code></pre>
<p>Your firmware for your MCU and IMU configuration should now be complete!</p>

<p>Uploading your firmware must initially be done over cable. Once you have the tracker connected to your WiFi after your first firmware update, you can opt to use OTA in the future.</p>
<h2 id="1-connect-your-tracker-to-your-pc"><a class="header" href="#1-connect-your-tracker-to-your-pc">1. Connect Your Tracker to Your PC</a></h2>
<p>If your microcontroller board has a button labeled <code>FLASH</code>, <code>BOOT</code> or <code>RESET</code>, press and hold the button and plug in the micro-USB cable. If you have different labels and/or buttons, please check your microcontroller's manual for more information.</p>
<p>Note that holding the button is not required for Wemos D1 Mini.</p>
<h2 id="2-build-your-firmware"><a class="header" href="#2-build-your-firmware">2. Build Your Firmware</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Follow the <a href="firmware/configuring-project.html">configuring the firmware project page</a> to prepare your project for building and uploading the firmware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press the build button at the bottom of Visual Studio Code.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EmSkhFp.png" alt="img" /></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="3-upload-your-firmware"><a class="header" href="#3-upload-your-firmware">3. Upload Your Firmware</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are using the OTA method, first make sure the tracker you wish to flash is turned on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the firmware has been built, press the upload button to upload the firmware.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lI3PFVC.png" alt="img" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the upload is successful, you should get an output that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SDQcCr1.png" alt="img" /></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations! You have now successfully uploaded the firmware to your SlimeVR Tracker!</p>
<p>If you have trouble with uploading your firmware over cable check the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure your USB cable from the tracker is plugged firmly into your PC.</li>
<li>Make sure that your USB cable is a data and charging cable (it is suggested you try other cables or devices with the cable).</li>
<li>Make sure that your drivers are up to date.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, this can be caused by software hogging COM ports (<strong>VSCode and Cura can be the cause of this</strong>).</p>
<h2 id="uploading-via-ota"><a class="header" href="#uploading-via-ota">Uploading via OTA</a></h2>
<p>Once you have successfully connected your trackers to your WiFi, you can use OTA to handle all future firmware updates.</p>
<ol>
<li>Retrieve the IP of the tracker you wish to flash. The IP can be found through network monitoring applications, or by copying it from the SlimeVR Server as seen in the image below:<br>
<img src="firmware/../assets/img/trackerIp.png" alt="tracker Ip" /></li>
<li>In <code>platformio.ini</code> file uncomment the following lines in Visual Studio Code by removing the <code>;</code>:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-ini">;upload_protocol = espota
;upload_port = 192.168.1.49
;upload_flags =
;  --auth=SlimeVR-OTA
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Change the value of upload_port to the IP address retrieved during the first step (if retrieved for your SlimeVR server you should only copy the set of 4 numbers between the second and third <code>/</code>, in the example image above this would be 192.168.1.109).</li>
<li>Turn the tracker you wish to flash off and then on again.</li>
<li>Wait for the tracker to reconnect to the server.</li>
<li>Press the upload button to upload the firmware.<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lI3PFVC.png" alt="img" /></li>
<li>After the upload reaches 100%, wait for the tracker to reconnect to the server again. Turning the device off too soon can result in an incomplete update (bricked until you upload new firmware over USB).</li>
<li>Repeat for as many trackers as you need.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="owotrack-app"><a class="header" href="#owotrack-app">owoTrack App</a></h1>
<p>owoTrack is a mobile application that can be used for VR tracking using your phone.
The application uses SlimeVR Server for tracking. To set up SlimeVR Server, refer to <a href="tools/../server-setup/slimevr-setup.html">SlimeVR setup guide</a>.</p>
<p>If you're using trackers/phones with owoTrack app for tracking, there is minimum amount of 5 trackers/phones for full body tracking. One phone can be used if you want only waist tracking. Waist tracking can also work with <a href="https://github.com/abb128/owo-track-driver">owoTrack SteamVR driver</a>, without SlimeVR.</p>
<p>Your PC and trackers/phones should connected to the same local network.</p>

<p>Your need at least 5 trackers or phones for FBT using SlimeVR.</p>
<h3 id="i-heard-i-could-use-3-phones-for-leg-tracking"><a class="header" href="#i-heard-i-could-use-3-phones-for-leg-tracking">I heard I could use 3 phones for leg tracking</a></h3>
<p>You can't. You will have a bad time, and that's not our fault. Your knees won't bend and it's an overall worst experience. Required minimum is 5.</p>
<h3 id="i-have-only-onetwo-phones"><a class="header" href="#i-have-only-onetwo-phones">I have only one/two phones</a></h3>
<p>‚ÄãYou can use the official owoTrack driver for waist or SlimeVR Server for waist (+ chest if you have 2 phones). This will not track your legs.</p>

<p>‚ÄãYou need to install Java in order to run SlimeVR Server. To download Java installer, visit <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">Java download page</a>.</p>
<p>‚ÄãFor more information, refer to <a href="tools/../server-setup/slimevr-setup.html">SlimeVR setup guide</a>.</p>

<p>‚ÄãMake sure you have the correct roles selected in the SlimeVR Server for your trackers/phones. They should be Waist, Left Uppper Leg, Right Uppper Leg, Left Lower Leg and Right Lower Leg.</p>
<p>To learn how to set up tracker roles, refer to <a href="tools/../server-setup/slimevr-setup.html">SlimeVR setup guide</a>.</p>

<p>‚ÄãYou need to assign roles to your trackers in SteamVR:</p>
<ol>
<li>In SteamVR, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Devices</strong> &gt; <strong>Manage Trackers</strong>.</li>
<li>In the tracker list, find the ones named <code>/devices/SlimeVR/SlimeVRTracker#</code> and give them the roles WAIST, LEFT_FOOT, RIGHT_FOOT from top to bottom.</li>
<li>Restart SteamVR.</li>

<p>‚ÄãCheck that the IP is correct.</p>
<p>‚Äã<strong>You can input 255.255.255.255 as IP to owoTrack Android app</strong></p>
<p>To check your IP address, you can open the Powershell window or Command Prompt window (cmd.exe) and execute <code>ipconfig</code> command and get your PC IPv4 address field - for example 192.168.1.2 and put it in owoTrack app.</p>

<p>Apple has restrictions on apps for networking in background. The workaround for this is currently being investigated.</p>
<p>To workaround this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable <strong>Guided Access</strong>. You can find this setting in <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt; <strong>Guided Access</strong>.</li>
<li>Disable screen auto-lock. To do this, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Display &amp; Brightness</strong>, tap <strong>Auto-Lock</strong> and set it to <strong>Never</strong>.</li>
<li>Start owoTrack app.</li>
<li>Turn down the screen brightness completely to save battery.</li>

<h2 id="setup-1"><a class="header" href="#setup-1">Setup</a></h2>
<p>You need bluetooth on your computer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and set up <a href="tools/../server-setup/initial-setup.html">SlimeVR</a></li>
<li>Download <a href="https://github.com/carl-anders/slimevr-wrangler/releases/latest/download/slimevr-wrangler.exe">SlimeVR Wrangler</a></li>
<li>Start both the SlimeVR server and SlimeVR Wrangler</li>
<li>Connect your Joy-Con trackers to the computer (<a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/how-to-connect-a-nintendo-switch-controller-to-a-pc/">Guide for Windows</a>)</li>
<li>Make sure the SlimeVR Server is running, then press &quot;Search for Joycons&quot; inside SlimeVR Wrangler</li>
<li>The Joy-Con should show up in the window!</li>
<li><a href="tools/../server-setup/connecting-trackers.html">Set up the new tracker in the SlimeVR Server</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mounting"><a class="header" href="#mounting">Mounting</a></h3>
<p>Keep the joystick pointed outwards, it should not poke into your skin.</p>
<p>After connecting the Joy-Con's in the program, rotate them in the program to be the same rotation as they are if you are standing up.</p>
<p>Attach the Joy-Con's in the direction that works best for you, refer to the page on <a href="tools/../server-setup/putting-on-trackers.html">putting on your trackers</a> for mounting position and tracker assignment.</p>
<h2 id="issues"><a class="header" href="#issues">Issues</a></h2>
<p>Many! This is an <strong>alpha</strong> version, and there's no guarantees about anything.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rotation tracking is bad! - Yup, sorry. In the future there will be settings to help fine tune the tracking. It's recommended to <a href="tools/../server-setup/setting-reset-bindings.html">set a keybinding to reset.</a></li>
<li>It stops tracking when I turn around! - Bluetooth does not have a good range, you might have better luck with a different bluetooth adapter.</li>
<li>Probably more.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="my-joy-cons-are-connected-in-the-windows-bluetooth-menu-but-wont-show-up"><a class="header" href="#my-joy-cons-are-connected-in-the-windows-bluetooth-menu-but-wont-show-up">My Joy-Con's are connected in the Windows bluetooth menu but won't show up!</a></h3>
<p>This is a problem that might be related to a newer Windows update. Try this, and it might fix it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the Windows Setting app -&gt; Bluetooth &amp; other devices.</li>
<li>Press on the Joy-Con that won't connect. Press &quot;Remove device&quot;.</li>
<li>Pair the device again. It should now show up.</li>

</ol>
<h1 id="setting-up-the-install-folder"><a class="header" href="#setting-up-the-install-folder">Setting up the install folder</a></h1>
<p>To most easily use the program, you'll need to have things structured in a specific way.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a new folder to contain your installation, name it whatever you want (ex. <code>SlimeVR Server</code>).</li>
<li>Place the SlimeVR Server, SlimeVR GUI, and Java JRE components you downloaded into the folder you made</li>
</ol>
<p>Example of the final directory structure:</p>
<pre><code>/SlimeVR Server/
    |- /jre/bin/java

    |- /slimevr-ui_0.0.0_amd64.AppImage
</code></pre>
<h1 id="running-the-program"><a class="header" href="#running-the-program">Running the program</a></h1>

<p>L,i,me is a case and hardware variant of the standard slime aimed to natively support a full <strong>9</strong> IMU setup (with work currently be done on an optional addon to allow 4 more IMUs) while being as streamlined as possible with no degredation to performance.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-this-for"><a class="header" href="#who-is-this-for">Who is this for?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>L,i,me is for those who wish to streamline their current standard slime setup by easily converting into a L,i,me.</li>
<li>For those who want to make a full no compromise 9 IMU setup from the start (with the option to add an extra 4 more IMUs for shoulder and elbow tracking).</li>
<li>People on a tight budget but want a performant full 9 IMU setup (with the option to add shoulder and elbow tracking in the future).</li>
<li>Those who intend to use slimevr for mocap and vtubing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-choose-lime"><a class="header" href="#why-choose-lime">Why choose L,i,me?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Unlike the standard set up that is limited to <strong>2 IMUs</strong> per tracker, each <strong>L,i,me</strong> tracker supports <strong>4 IMUs</strong> (without any software modification). Due to this you only need to make 3 L,i,me trackers instead of 6 typical slime trackers for a full 9 IMU setup.</li>
<li>Less parts required, making L,i,me the cheapest full 9 IMU setup (as well as 13 IMU setup with optional addon).</li>
<li>Aimed at providing the best stable tracking with comfort and full maneuverability due to being less bulky overall (less main trackers).</li>
<li>Only need to charge and maintain 3 trackers (4 if you include the optional addon).</li>
<li>Modular and customisable.</li>
<li>Ongoing support.</li>
<li>Future octoslime support (double battery life).</li>
</ul>

<p>Required components and software:</p>
<ul>
<li>A HMD with great virtual desktop support like the Oculus quest 2.</li>
<li>An active shadow pc subscription.</li>
<li>A client for shadow pc that supports usb forwarding like a windows pc with shadow's official app or a virtual here license with an always on computer. A raspberry pi works.</li>
<li>A usb to Ethernet adapter. It's possible to use a usb WiFi adapter that supports windows 10 hotspot functionality, however ethernet tends to be more reliable.</li>
<li>A license for virtual desktop.</li>
<li>A device that can stay awake while you're in vr that supports the official shadow pc client, for example an iPad.</li>
<li>A fast 5ghz WiFi router that also supports 2.4ghz, almost any dual band router should suffice.</li>
<li>An Ethernet cable and free Ethernet port at your router for the usb to Ethernet adapter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steps to setup:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to shadow pc, install:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>virtual desktop streamer</li>
<li>steam</li>
<li>steam vr</li>
<li>any desired steam vr game</li>
<li>the slime vr server</li>
<li>virtual here (if you need it if usb forwarding does not work for your shadow client)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Connect the lan cable and ensure the usb forwarding is set up for that adapter.</li>
<li>Shadow pc should show a new Ethernet connection in the network and sharing center.</li>
<li>Make sure that the connection is set to private, keep shadows main Ethernet connection alone.</li>
<li>Once all of slimes are connected to your WiFi router that the Ethernet cable is also connected to, launch slime vr server on shadow pc. The slimes should show up and be reporting their rotation data.</li>
<li>Configure slimes following the official documentation.</li>
<li>Launch your vr game and enjoy.</li>
</ol>
<p>To improve performance make the shadow pc official client only use 5mbps max of bandwidth.
Disabling video buffering in virtual desktop helped the most for vr gameplay.
Having a fast connection will improve your experience.
For usb forwarding the upload is the most important.</p>
